He is credited for popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Despite that his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him controversial in most aspects, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been recognized as an influence for many artists of various genres.</p><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@itsjanweber">Jan Weber</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com"> Unsplash</a></figcaption>
