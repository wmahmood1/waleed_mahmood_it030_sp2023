			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>Mathers was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae "Debbie" Mathers. He is of Scottish, Welsh, English, Cherokee, German, Swiss, Polish, and Luxemburgish ancestry. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotasâ€“Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when he was an infant, and Marshall was raised only by his mother, Debbie. While struggling with poverty, he and his mother constantly moved several times between Kansas City and Detroit before permanently settling in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan at the age of 12.</p>
			<p>As a child, Mathers was often bullied. One bully named D'Angelo Bailey assaulted him by severely injuring head. His mother, Debbie, sued the public school in 1982. However, the case was dismissed by the Macomb County judge, who stated that the schools were immune from lawsuits. While residing in Warren, Michigan during his youth, Mathers and his mother were one of the three whitle households on their block since the neighborhood was predominantly an African-American neighborhood.</p>
			<p>At first, he was interested in storytelling, to which he aspired to become a comic book artist. After listening to his first rap song, Reckless by Ice-T, he began to develop a passion for hip-hop. </p>
			<p>Mathers had spent three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades. Even though, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at the age of 17, he did have an interest in studying the English dictionary. At the age of 14, he started rapping with his high-school friend Mike Ruby. They adopted the names "Manix" and "M&M", which later evolved into "Eminem." In addition, Eminem and his other friend, DeShaun Holton a.k.a. Proof, would sneak into their neighboring Osborn High School and participate in lunchroom freestyle rap battles. Every Saturday, Eminem and Proof attended open mic rap battles at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road. Despite struggling to succeed in a black music industry, he was still praised by underground hip hop audiences.</p>
			<p>When Emienm was 15, he met his soon-to-be-wife, Kimberly Anne Scott. While they both met at a party, Kim stayed at Eminem's house for one night under the permission of his mother. They soon starting dating in 1990 and had their first child, Hailie Jade Mathers, who was born five years later. The couple then split for three years before rekindinling their romance and getting married in 1999, but by 2006, Eminem had filed for divorce.</p>
			<h2>Career Beginnings</h2>
			<p>Eminem released his first album, <i>Infinite,</i> in 1996. It considered as a commercial faliure because only 1,000 copies of the album was sold through Eminem's car. Due to being operated as a battle rapper, he was encouraged to compete at the 1997 Rap Olympics. While unknowingly being saved by a label intern in the crowd, Mathers' demo ended up in the hands of Dr. Dre. As an artist signed to Aftermath Entertainment, Eminem released <i>The Slim Shady LP</i> in 1999, which became a certified triple platinum by the end of the year.</p>
			<h2>Feuds</h2>
			<p>Throughout his career, Eminem has had some lyrical disputes with other recording aristis. These artists include Christina Aguilera, Machine Gun Kelly, Everlast, Limp Bizkit, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, Ja Rule, Benzino, Vanilla Ice, Canibus, Lord Jamar, Joe Budden, Charleamagne the God, and many others.</p>
